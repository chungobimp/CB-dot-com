									'ChungoBimp' is my alter ego, my name is Ian and I am a Freelance Information Architect and Project Manager. I have a background in 'real' Architecture and business experience at every stakeholder level from Ground level Sales, Business Operations and Senior Management ... and as a client. For the last 12 years I've turned clients needs and wants into deliverable products, always determined to improve the daily lives of people everywhere. I also wish for world peace ... oh, hang on.
								<br />	
									I'm not a programmer, I'm not a Network Engineer, I'm not a Graphic Genius; I am a Designer, a Problem Solver who knows how to solve someone's needs and then find and work with the people who have the specialised skills to do what they do best for your benefit.
								<br />	
									I am an information sponge; As I cruise through this world we live in, I absorb an array of random information about life, the universe and everything. I analyse Products, Designs and Processes every day, pondering new ways of doing things quickly and efficiently and how they can be applied to make the world better for everyone, including you.

									I'm sure you are a little curious as to what I can do to help you and your IT project. Read through some of my <a href="#">Blog Articles</a>, browse the <a href="#">services</a> I offer and feel free to <a href="mailto:hello@chungobimp.com?Subject=Enquiry%20from%20ChungoBimp%20Website">drop me a line</a> - it could mean the difference between a success or failure of your IT project, and unlike a lawyer, I don't charge to talk to you.
